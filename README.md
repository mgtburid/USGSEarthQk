# USGSEarthQk
Accesses United States Geological Survey data on earthquakes.


The idea was grasped from one of the Python For Beginners courses on Lynda.com. Some parts of the code may be an exact copy of what has been demonstrated by the instructor in the aforementioned course.

Currently a user may choose several options such as a time period and a magnitude.

Time period has four options: an hour, a day, a week, and a month.
Magnitude has five options: all, 1.0+, 2.5+, 4.5+, and significant.

Each configuration a user chooses is available on USGS' website. The output will consist of the title of the chosen configuration, the number of earthquakes that took place during the provided period, their magnitudes, and their geolocation. Additionally, sometimes USGS provides information on how a given magnitude felt.

After the code has been executed successfully, a user is given an opportunity to run it again or exit the program. The program is user-friendly and gives necessary explanations as it runs.
